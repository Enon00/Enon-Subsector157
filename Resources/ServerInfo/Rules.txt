# ZERO TOLERANCE RULES

[head=3][color=#ff0000]You must be 18 or older to play. Users under 18 will be banned immediately.[/head][/color]

The rules below are absolute. Players caught violating them may be banned without prior warning.
 
  - Absolutely no hate speech, including slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, or ableism.
  - Absolutely no sexual content or erotic roleplay (ERP), including direct mentions of sexual behavior, or actions. You can be in a relationship with another character.
 - Players must be at least 18 years of age to play on Subsector: 157 servers. Any player under 18 years old will be banned until they are of age.
  - The end of the round does not exempt you from other rules.

  - All communication related to the current game round must happen in-game or through the in-character #chitter channel on our official discord server.
  -- [color=#ff0000]Voice calls with other players or other forms of metacommunication are forbidden[/color], will not be tolerated by admins and any involved will be assumed to be abusing the game.
  -- Streaming the game is allowed. But only as a shift participant, never as an observer or ghost, with the exception of observing your own body after death.
  - Do not use exploits, cheats, or external programs to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt the server in any way.
  - Attempting to evade game bans or job/role bans will result in an appeal-only ban.
  -Do not join the game using multiple accounts

# 1. Community Expectations

-Everyone here is playing to have a good time and have fun. Respect other players and the stories they are trying to be a part of. Your story may collide with theirs in a violent way. Such is the way of space. Thankfully, out here, the end is never really the end.  

# 2. In-context Info

-Keep everything in the place it belongs. It hurts roleplay when your character starts talking about stuff they should not know.

## 2.1 IC/OC and Meta-friending

  - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means (e.g. as a ghost).
  - Do not say in character (IC) things in the local out of character (LOOC) chat channel.
  - Do not say LOOC things in IC, like saying you “need to go afk because your dog wants to go outside,” in the IC chat. This includes Chitter in-game and in our official discord.
  - Characters can keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters.

## 2.2 Cloning and Revival

  - After cloning, respawning, or taking a ghost role, you must follow:
  -- You can remember everything that happened before being incapacitated. Your memories are fuzzy at first but become perfectly clear after about 15 mins. See Rule 3.
  -- When taking a ghost role, you know [bold]nothing[/bold] about your previous characters while playing that role.
  - Do not respawn as the same character if given a confinement sentence or execution.
  - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted (see 2.1).

# 3. Escalation Guidelines

	- Antagonistic ghost roles and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack.
	- As a non-antagonist, don't attack player-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
	- A 15 minute non-aggression period caused by fuzzy memory and/or grogginess that is required after respawning, so you can't immediately get in a ship and try to go kill whoever killed you. 
	- SF and command roles must resolve situations with non-lethal force and attempt to solve verbally IC confrontation before moving to non-lethal means of physical restraint. Lethal force is only authorized if it is in response to lethal force by the suspect directed at the SF or Command member themselves.

	-PVP violence escalation procedure:

	-Verbal altercations lead to…
	-Examples of verbal altercations: 
	--Call someone out for a fight over comms
	--Send them a threatening fax 
	--Dock and tell them to hand over their money / goods
    
	-Physical altercations which then leads to a…
	-Examples of physical altercations: 
	--Get into a fist fight
	--Fire a warning shot
	--Brandish a melee weapon and strike an object near you such as a wall or chair    
    
	-Lethal altercations
	-Examples of lethal altercations: 
	--Exchange fire with lethal rounds 
	--Trade blows with highly damaging weaponry
	--Gittin' ‘em

- If a fight ends and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. What's done is done. Verbal / Physical contact must be reestablished before unleashing a lethal response.

# 4. Chat and Language Guidelines

All staff speaks English and so does the rest of the community, breaking any of these rules might end in a server kick or ban.

	- Do not spam.
	- Do not advertise OOC. If you are selling out of game goods/services for money you will be perma-banned.  

# 5. General Roleplay Guidelines

Your IC name must be reasonable and fit into the game's setting. This is a roleplay server first and foremost, so give your character the effort it deserves.

## 5.1 Naming

-No names of people or characters from the real world
-No titles/honorifics
-Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
-Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below.
-Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin
-Clowns and mimes are exempt from the prohibition on titles/honorifics, and have loosened restrictions on low effort and implausible names.

-Meta names are ones which attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name used for admin spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.

## 5.2 Meta/Chat

	- Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (memes, spam, copy/pasta) are not acceptable.
	- Do not use Netspeak when talking in-character. (idk, imo, l337) 

# 6. Mythimna Main-Station Safe Zone

[color=red]Mythimna Starport and the 200 meter radius around it is considered a safe zone. Absolutely no antag activity or griefing is permitted within that zone.[/color]

	The following rules apply to the safe zone:
	- Do not destroy or damage the structure of Mythimna Starport.
	- Do not destroy, modify, remove, or restrict the use of any machine or device designed for public use on Mythimna Starport.
	-- This includes hacking or sabotaging airlocks.
	- The Port Authority (station head) approval is required for any modifications of the station.
	-- Modifications for the purposes of engaging in commerce or sale of a service must be kept to the hallway between central station and cargo, known as the Commercial Concourse. 
	- Player fights and confrontations ARE allowed in the safe zone but the mass murder of uninvolved bystanders is not. 
	- Dangerous research on artifacts and anomalies must not be done while inside the safe zone.
	- Pirate actions may not occur or start on Mythimna Starport. This includes:
	-- Stowing away while at Mythimna Starport with intentions to steal a ship.
	-- Stealing ships or ships' cargo.
	-- Selling someone else's ship you hadn't pirated outside the safe zone.
	-- Joining a crew under false pretenses with the intent to mutiny and take the ship.
	- Pirates may bribe a player or players to act as moles within crews. 
	- Players must make best efforts to keep the docks at Mythimna Starport free and clear for the use of others, with the exception of the Commercial Concourse docks with Port Authority permission.

#7. Antagonism

You may be an Antagonist of your own design. (e.g. Mafia Family, Smuggler Gang, Drug King-Pin, Illegal Bookie, Cypher Killer ect. ect.) 
	--You must abide by the rules of escalation (see rule 3) 
	--You must understand that you will likely be targeted by other players as an outlaw.
	--You must understand that you could end up with this character as a prisoner for multiple shift or retired via execution.

# 8. Player vs. Player Combat

Follow escalation and allow surrender.

	- Follow escalation guidelines (see Rule 3) before attacking other players' shuttles.
	- The crew of non-hostile vessels that surrender should not be killed, left stranded, or left bankrupt.
	-- The safety of surrendered vessels and crew should be guaranteed by all parties.
	-- Only the goods aboard a ship are valid plunder. All players' bank accounts must remain untouched. Cash on hand counts as goods.
	-- A ship containing villainous forces may have assistance given by admins to Security Forces to bring them to justice. But direct intervention by the admins to bring rule abiding law-breakers to justice is forbidden. 
	- All suspects/hostages taken alive must be adequately cared for according to Space Law.

# 9. Piracy

	- [color=#ff0000]The safe zone rules still apply to pirates.[/color]

	-Pirates cannot be recruited from general population.
	--If you want information from a ship's crew you need to hire/bribe an existing one as a mole, the mole can not be someone from your crew that you convinced the captain to hire to train or any other such subterfuge.

	-You may use whatever strategy you see fit so long as it fits with the ESCALATION PROCEDURE (see rule 3)
	-Pirates rely on trade ships existing so you can commit acts of piracy against them to sustain yourself, do not hunt them to extinction. 

	-Becoming a pirate means you become a resource (bounty) that other players may freely target, even without a warrant or official bounty notice. If you lose a fight and someone turns you in, you go to timeout and they get a reward.

	-Being a successful pirate will bring you infamy which can end with you and your crew spending multiple shifts on The Rock, a prison POI. 
	--Being sent to The Rock permanently or being sentenced to an execution are ways your character can be temporarily or permanently retired by others. You must understand and respect this element of this shared storytelling experience. 
	-Pirates turned over dead or alive are to be revived or cloned and detained for the duration of the shift.
	
	- Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain, sentient pets and cyborgs.
	-- Round start pets (e.g. Clarrrpy) do not count towards this limit.
	- There may only be one Pirate Captain and one First Mate at any time.
	- Pirates may not operate without a First Mate or Captain present.
	-- If the leader of the pirates has been captured or killed, the remaining pirates may make efforts to rescue them.
	-- First Mates and Captains are required to open their job slot prior to going to cryo, or ahelp if this is not possible. Inform your crew of what they can do in your absence.
	- If a player surrenders, they should not be killed. 
	-- Following escalation guidelines, if a player fights, then all goods on their ship are fair game. However, you must leave the ship in a state where it is able to fly as a minimum.
	-- If a player resumes combat after being revived and is killed again, they do not have to be revived again.
	- Pirates must not hunt for smuggling notes.
	-- Smuggling crates are fair game as plunder.
	- Pirates cannot force interactions which result in player or command bank accounts being robbed.

A Note on Dealing with Pirates: 
-Captains who are found to be in violation of laws of escalation during a pirate roleplaying scenario can be banned by admins.
	--Example: A pirate pulls up to a ship and hails them to surrender their goods. The merchant captain is not following the order of escalation if they immediately open up fire upon the pirates with ship-based weaponry. They are following the rules of escalation if they fire warning shots near their ship as a show of force or if they verbally warn the pirates to leave and give them a chance to do so before you fire the guns. EVERYONE must abide by rules of escalation.

# 10. Crimes and Fines

Server rules must be followed, but Space Law can be broken with some considerations.

	- If a silicon is responsible for a crime, the person giving the order is to be charged.
	- Punishment can compound depending on the number of counts of a single crime and the severity.
	-- Refer to Space Law for a list of fines, punishments, and limits.
	- You must wait at least 20 minutes to loot, salvage, or claim an abandoned shuttle.
	-- This 20 minutes starts from when you confirm it is abandoned.
	-Do NOT knowingly/willingly commit an act of mass murder unless you are a pirate crew being attacked and the murder is committed against the crew attacking you or as a syndicate death-squad member. All other criminal actions must abide by the rules of escalation. (e.g. Do not leave a bomb without calling a threat / way for people to escape as well.)

# 11. Silicons and Law-bound entities

You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, the Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules. 

#12. SF and 157 Command Staff Standards

You are the law, you should know the law and enforce it evenly and fairly.

	- Security Forces (SF) and Command 157 Staff roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay.
	-- These roles are considered as civil staff and are strictly non-antagonists.
	-- Abuse of the equipment provided to work in these roles is strictly prohibited.
	- SF officers roleplaying as 'bad cops' and intentionally violating space law is forbidden.
	-- Space Law is not optional for these roles, and working knowledge is required before taking a security or command position.
	- Both SF and other Civil Staff are expected to display reasonable levels of competence and performance on their jobs.
	- SF officers must follow SF the chain of command and should know StanOp (see Wiki in the menu for more details).
	- Assets seized from criminals may only be used to make victims whole and to pay for any fines under the law.
	-- Excess funds received from the sale of criminal assets are to be returned to their original owners.
	-- These assets are not to be plundered or embezzled by security forces.
	-- This is a strict zero-tolerance policy.
	- The SF are allowed to use their knowledge of ship layouts in order to aid ship searches.
	-- SF may not activate dead drops themselves or work with others to activate dead drops.
	- Money found on board vessels belonging to hostile corporations can be seized and deposited into the SF bank account. Officers may not keep these funds for personal use.
	- Unlike outlaws, citizens are protected from improper search and seizure, high fines, and long sentences for legal infractions. Please see Space Law for guidelines for punishments.

# 13. Command Standards 

You are not just the highest authority in the sector apart from Central Command, you are a representative of Mythimna Starport. Please, treat your duties with some degree of seriousness. 


	- Command roles (e.g. Port Authority, Sheriff) are held to a much higher standard of roleplay.
	- Command is [color=#ff0000]required[/color] to maintain pay for their respective staff as a part of their job.
	-- You are expected to maintain pay for roles absent other command positions, within reason.
	-- Minimum hourly pay rates are $10,000 for station crew, $20,000 for Station Rep and Sheriff, and $15,000 for security.
	-- Embezzlement of station funds is strictly forbidden.
	- If ending your shift early:
	-- Have your ID on your character.
	-- Reopen your position at the station records computer.
	-- Return to cryosleep.
	-- If you cannot (disconnect, crash, power outage, etc.), ping the game admins in Discord if you can.
	-- Ensure you open your job slot prior to going to cryo.
	-- You are welcome to open that slot early in order for a new SR or Sheriff to join so you can provide a briefing to them beforehand.
	-- Ahelp if you are unable to pay your staff prior to going to cryo.
	- Command is expected to enforce docking laws and collect any fines related to dock loitering.
	-- Refer to Space Law for the specific laws on dock loitering.
	-- Funds collected from this may be used for station payroll or station supplies.
	-- Traffic to and from traffic-controlled stations should be kept flowing.
	- You may not tax, lease, rent, or otherwise impede the use of station resources. This includes:
	-- Charging docking fees.
	-- Granting docking extensions.
	-- Restricting vendor access (e.g. placing machines behind locked doors).
	-- Restricting access to station resources.
	- The Sheriff or SR are under no obligation to offer to purchase contraband from other players. Seizure of illegal goods is always allowed under Space Law.
	-- If contraband buy-backs or contraband hunting schemes are to be offered, how they are conducted is at the discretion of the SR or Sheriff.
	-- Admins will not grant compensation to players for contraband which is seized by the authorities.
	- The Sheriff is to ensure that any recruited cadets receive proper training and are supervised properly at all times.
	-- Cadets should be working alongside the Sheriff or assigned to a suitably experienced officer who can oversee their training as an officer and in Space Law, SOP and the server rules relating to the SF.
	-- Cadets who refuse training, try to farm playtime or insist on working alone can face consequences or be ahelped for their actions.
	-- Repeated incidents may be considered a sign of poor leadership. Cadets are your responsibility.
